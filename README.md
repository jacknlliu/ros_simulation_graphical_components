# ros_simulation_graphical_components
collection of graphical components for modern simulation based ROS

# Motivation

[V-REP](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) has many graphical compoents for modern simulation, but ROS always uses the background 
config file or commands to achieve this.

This project aims to shorten the learning route from zero to play.

- URDF GUI Generator
- Gazebo import model from CAD model directly, Gazebo export model to CAD model format(such as, `.obj`)
- Gazebo simulation with simple script and GUI to control robot directly without many codes then to see what happends
- Gazebo show path of the motion directly without rviz. Gazebo should combine some function from rviz.
